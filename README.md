# Spring2015-CSO-Project2-Cache-Optimization

## Description

This project is to show a deeper understanding of C optimization in relation to the underlying hardware specifications given.

This means optimizing the code to avoid "cache misses", which can cause delays when executing code, due to the processor having to then either go to a lower cache, or even to memory to retrieve 
the files it requires.
